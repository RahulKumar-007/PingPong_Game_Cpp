# Pong Game

## Project Architecture

This Pong Game project is implemented without utilizing any game engine services. It is built using native C++ programming and does not rely on external game development frameworks or engines. The decision to forgo a game engine was made to provide a clear understanding of fundamental game development concepts and to keep the project lightweight and accessible for learning purposes.

### Key Points

1. **Native C++ Implementation:** The entire game logic, rendering, and input handling are implemented directly in C++ without leveraging external game engines like Unity, Unreal Engine, or Godot.

2. **2D Graphics Library:** For rendering, the project uses a basic 2D graphics library, and the rendering functions are custom-built within the codebase. This allows for a more hands-on approach to graphics rendering.

3. **Physics and Collision Handling:** Physics simulation and collision detection are implemented from scratch, without relying on physics engines commonly found in game development frameworks.

4. **Platform Independence:** The project is designed to be platform-independent, and the codebase does not rely on platform-specific game engine services. It can be compiled and run on different systems with a C++ compiler.

5. **Lightweight and Educational:** By avoiding the use of game engines, this project aims to provide a clear and educational exploration of game development concepts. It allows developers to delve into the intricacies of game programming without the abstractions introduced by game engines.

### Benefits

- **Learning Experience:** Developers can gain a deeper understanding of game development concepts, including rendering, physics, and input handling, by directly working with C++.

- **Customization:** Without the constraints of a game engine, the project is highly customizable, and developers have full control over the implementation details.

- **Portability:** The project can be easily adapted and compiled on various platforms without the need for platform-specific configurations.

### Limitations

- **Advanced Features:** While suitable for learning and basic game development, this project might lack some advanced features and optimizations that can be easily implemented using established game engines.

- **Development Time:** Building a game without a game engine may require more development time compared to using pre-built engine services for certain functionalities.

### Conclusion

This project's decision to avoid game engine services is intentional, providing a transparent and insightful look into the mechanics of game development.
